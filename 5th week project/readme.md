## by Duy Pham


## Investigation Overview

> The overall goal is to understand the possible changes in the user behavior with the Lyft biking business in COVID-19. This analysis does not aim to produce a causal inference but focus on the potential consequences that we can observe in March, or more specifically, the later half of March 2020. 

## Dataset Overview

> The dataset includes the following **13 variables**, with a total of **1,480,500 observations**.

> - Trip Duration (seconds)
> - Start Time and Date
> - End Time and Date
> - Start Station ID
> - Start Station Name
> - Start Station Latitude
> - Start Station Longitude
> - End Station ID
> - End Station Name
> - End Station Latitude
> - End Station Longitude
> - Bike ID
> - User Type

## Summary of Findings

> 1. The COVID-19 definitely impacted the general number of bike rides in terms of session count. 
> 2. The COVID-19 and shelter-in-place order have changed the way people use Lyft bike. For example, significantly lower number of people Lyft biking session in the morning, and much more people are biking on Sunday (proportionally). 
> 3. The COVID-19 and shelter-in-place order do not seem to change the duration per session. 
> 4. The COVID-19 and shelter-in-place order changes the proportion of customer_type. A significant lower number of subscribers do not use Lyft bike session compared to the traditional customers.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> Subscribers are likely to bike to work. Further study should aim to understand if additional app function (breakfast on the way to work) would be captivating to current subscribers.
